# Pansy AMM

Pansy AMM proposes a new approach to liquidity provision in DeFi with a smart AMM that achieves high returns and low impermanent loss to the limit. Existing liquidity provision suffers from low returns due to liquidity fragmentation and high risk due to impermanent loss. Pansy AMM solves these issues by using demand-based liquidity management and a currency basket pool with a pricing mechanism based on market price rather than coin balances in the pool. This makes impermanent loss low to the limit and provides zero slippage to traders for market price. Pansy AMM incentivizes swaps that improve the pool balance and penalizes swaps that worsen it. Pansy AMM is highly composable with other protocols and will be a new liquidity infrastructure to facilitate the DeFi ecosystem.

## Features
